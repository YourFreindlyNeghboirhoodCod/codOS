# codOS
my CC operating system
these games were not made by me, there is credits in the code for each of them!
this operating system will fit on a floppy disk.

note: things are very buggy and subject to change, this OS was made in a day, on a survival world!

INSTALLATION:
you must use a github getter to install this OS, use pastebin get wPtGKMam github to get the github program!
then once you have gotten it, just type github YourFreindlyNeghboirhoodCod codOS
move downloads/codOS into the main folder, then move startup out of codOS into the main folder

HOW TO CHANGE PASSWORD:
once you've installed codOS, the default password is 0000, then you can just edit startup and find the "pass" varaible, just edit that then ur good :D
